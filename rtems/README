This directory contains the support files for building
the sockets-constants.ads file for RTEMS.  See the
README.RTEMS in the top level directory for complete
build instructions.

Prerequisites
=============
Build and install a working GNAT/RTEMS toolset and a BSP. Make sure
networking and POSIX are enabled.  Detailed instructions are available
online in the RTEMS Wiki at:

    http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMSAda

Run at least one sample from the RTEMS build (e.g. hello.exe
or sample.exe) to confirm that RTEMS itself was properly built.

Build and run the RTEMS hello_world_ada from the ada-examples
package using your GNAT/RTEMS development environment.

If everything is working at this point, then you are ready to
build AdaSockets.

Building AdaSockets
===================
We can now build the AdaSockets library.  Makefile.adasockets is
provided for this step:

RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=install_patch_of_BSP \
  make -f Makefile.lib

After the library is compiled, it may be installed using the following:

RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=install_patch_of_BSP \
  make -f Makefile.lib install
