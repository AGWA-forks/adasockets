INSTALL file for adasockets.

+++ To install this software on Unix or Cygwin/Windows, just do:

  % ./configure --prefix=<any directory>
  % make install

This will build and install this software under <any directory>/lib/adasockets.
The adasockets-config program and its associated man page will be installed
respectively under <any directory>/bin and <any directory>/man/

In the examples subdirectory, you will find an example called "tcprelay" which
illustrates how this package can be used.

GNU make is not strictly necessary but is recommended. It is needed if
you want to rebuild the documentation.

+++ To build this software on OpenVMS, just do:

 % make

GNU make must be available as well as the DEC C compiler. If no C
compiler is available on your system, the file sockets-constants.ads
in the contrib/vms directory must be copied into the vms one. This
file is given as is and has not been tested on other host than the one
used to port AdaSockets.
